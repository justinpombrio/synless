# Synless

    I think that I shall never see
    A poem lovely as a tree.
    - Joyce Kilmer

Synless is a document and code editor. Unlike most editors, it is
aware that documents and code have structure beyond their text
representation.



## Misc

Principles:

- Every node must fall inside of a rectangle, such that siblings'
rectangles do not overlap.

- Reading the document line by line must be the same as reading the
tree inorder.
